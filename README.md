- @waltpfau is whoiam
- I'm passionate about Digital Literacy and online safety.
- My personal utopia is a world where everyone has the technical
 knowledge to use a machine, the critical thinking skills to analyze 
 the information, and the etiquette required to be respectful and stay 
 out of trouble.

- Outside of digital literacy, my interests with technology primarily
 are in tinkering, home labbing, and building technology to improve 
 my day-to-day life. I believe in the right to privacy, and am working 
 to ensure technology is a rising tide to lift all ships.
