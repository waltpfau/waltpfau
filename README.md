- Watsup!! Iâ€™m @waltpfau. 
- I'm passionate about Digital Literacy and online safety.
- I want everyone to have the technical knowledge to use a machine,
 the critical thinking skills to analyze the information, and the
 etiquette required to be respectful and stay out of trouble.

- Outside of digital literacy, my interests with technology primarily
 lie in tinkering, home labbing, and repurposing technology to
 improve my day-to-day life. I believe in the right to privacy, and
 am working to ensure technology is a rising tide to lift all ships.
